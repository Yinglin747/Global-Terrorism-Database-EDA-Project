#### Global-Terrorism-Database-EDA-Project

Hello and thank you for checking out my project!
<br><br>In this project, I analysed over 210,000 terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 to 2021 with Python and drew conclusions on their distributions and patterns.
Tools/packages used:
Python,
Pandas,
Numpy,
Matplotlib,
Seaborn,
GeoPandas
<br><br>Please note:
<br>1) The bar chart race in the jupyter notebook is not showing properly, but you can find it in the "graphs and animation" folder.
<br>2) The original Excel file from Global Terrorism Databaseâ„¢ (GTD) that covers data from 1970 to 2020 is too large to upload to this repository, but can be downloaded at https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/contact/download
